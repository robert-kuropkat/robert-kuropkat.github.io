        Welcome to the starting point of my GitHub shenanigans.  I am just now exploring the GitHub universe 
        and see what I can do with it.  Becuase of that, there may be random brokeness or quirkiness as I 
        evolve from "default" to "refined."  Hopefully, this will serve as a useful jump point for my various
        efforts.
